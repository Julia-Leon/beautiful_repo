# Beautiful Repository

  This is the lab in which we have to learn how to make a `read.me` file structured, readable and interesting for possible lectors.
  To do that, we have created a new repository in which we have added the Logistic Regression exercise notebook.
  In this [notebook](), we have used the database of a bank, created a dataframe and applied a logistic regression training model. We wanted to predict if new clients will be reliable or not.
  Unfortunately the data we got were very imbalanced and we did not get a well predicting model and we have to work on that and build the model again.
